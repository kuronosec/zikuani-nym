# zikuani-nym
Private mixnet network layer for the Zikuani wallet

# Getting started

This repo provides a PoC example of how to use the Python web3 library to connect to Ethereum Virtaul Machine (EVM) compatible, with the added network privacy protection of the Nym mixnet.

## Install the Nym TcpProxy

Nym provides a couple of standalone binaries to connect appliactions to the mixing network, that you can find here: (TcpProxy binaries)[https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/src/tcp_proxy/bin]. Take a look here how to compile or dowload the binaries (Documenation)[https://nym.com/docs/developers/binaries].
