# zikuani-nym
Private mixnet network layer for the Zikuani wallet

# Getting started

This repo provides a PoC example of how to use the Python web3 library to connect to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible RPC endpoints, with the added network level privacy protection of the Nym mixnet.

## Install the Nym TcpProxy

Nym provides a couple of standalone binaries to connect appliactions to the mixing network, that you can find here: (TcpProxy binaries)[https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/src/tcp_proxy/bin]. Take a look here of how to compile or dowload the binaries (Documenation)[https://nym.com/docs/developers/binaries].
